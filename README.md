The PII Codex project was built as a core part of an ongoing research effort in Personal Identifiable Information (PII) detection and risk assessment. There was a need to not only detect PII in unstructured text, but also identify its severity, associated categorizations in cybersecurity research and policy documentation, and provide a way for others in similar research efforts to reproduce or extend the research. PII Codex is a combination of systematic research, conceptual frameworks, third-party open source software, and cloud service provider integrations. The categorizations are directly influenced by the research of Milne et al. (2016) while the ranking is a result of category severities on the scale provided by Schwartz and Solove (2012) from Non-Identifiable, Semi-Identifiable, and Identifiable.

The outputs of the primary PII Codex analysis and adapter functions are AnalysisResult or AnalysisResultSet objects that will provide a listing of detections, severities, mean risk scores for each string processed, and summary statistics on the analysis made. The final outputs do not contain the original texts but instead will provide where to find the detections should the end-user care for this information in their analysis.

## Importing
The repository releases are hosted on PyPi.

Using pip:

```bash
pip3 install -i pii-codex
```

Using Poetry:

```bash
poetry add pii-codex
```

If you are in need of the integrated Microsoft Presidio Analyzer, you'll also need to install the `en_core_web_lg` and the PII-Codex extras:

```bash
poetry install pii-codex --extras="detections"
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

## Usage

### Sample Input / Output
The built-in analyzer uses Microsoft Presidio. Feed in a collection of strings with analyze_collection() or just a single string with analyze_item(). Those analyzing a collection of strings will also be provided with statistics calculated on the risk scores for detected items.
```python
from pii_codex.services.analysis_service import PIIAnalysisService
PIIAnalysisService().analyze_collection(
    texts=["your collection of strings"],
    language_code="en",
    collection_name="Data Set Label", # Optional Labeling
    collection_type="SAMPLE" # Defaults to POPULATION, used stats calculations
)
```

Sample output (results object converted to `dict` from notebook):
```
